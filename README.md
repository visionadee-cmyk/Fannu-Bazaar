## 🔐 Authentication

The app uses a mock authentication system with demo accounts:

### Customer Accounts
- **Email**: `customer@demo.com` → Select any customer profile
- **Role**: Customer

### Worker Accounts  
- **Email**: `worker@demo.com` → Select any worker profile
- **Role**: Worker

### Admin Account
- **Email**: `admin@demo.com`
- **Role**: Admin

## ✅ Completed Jobs tabs

- Customer Dashboard has a **Completed** tab.
- Worker Dashboard has a **Completed** tab.
- Completed jobs are separated from active jobs so the main lists stay clean.

## � Activate / Deactivate behavior

- Admin can toggle **Active / Inactive** for customers and workers.
- **Inactive users will not appear in the Sign in (demo) profile list**, and the app blocks key actions for deactivated users.

## �📊 Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Customer profiles with contact information
- **Workers**: Service provider profiles with skills, rates, and ratings
- **Service Requests**: Job requests with workflow status tracking
- **Service Categories**: Available service types (AC, Plumbing, Electrical, Carpentry, Other)

Note: currency in the UI is **MVR**.

### Workflow States
Each service request progresses through these states:
- `open` → `pending_customer_confirmation` → `inspection_pending_worker_proposal` → `inspection_pending_customer_confirmation` → `inspection_scheduled` → `inspection_completed_pending_customer_confirm` → `awaiting_quote` → `quote_pending_approval` → `work_pending_worker_schedule` → `work_pending_customer_confirmation` → `work_scheduled` → `work_completed_pending_customer_confirm` → `payment_pending` → `completed`
